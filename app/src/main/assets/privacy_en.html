<h1>Data Protection Information &ndash; Stop Corona App</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is offering you this service?</h1>
<p>The &ldquo;Stop Corona&rdquo; App (in the following text we only call it the "App") is provided by the Austrian Red Cross:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Austrian Red Cross </strong></p>
<p>General ministry and blood donation centre for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland</p>
<p>Wiedner Hauptstrasse 32</p>
<p>1040 Vienna</p>
<p>ZVR number: 432857691</p>
<p>Email:&nbsp; service@roteskreuz.at</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you read "we" or "us" in the rest of the document, it means the Austrian Red Cross.</p>
<p>According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are the controller.</p>
<p>The GDPR is an EU regulation that ensures that your personal data is protected. It is very important to us to protect you and your data. Therefore, we are offering you this app and comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the Austrian Data Protection Act (Datenschutzgesetz, DSG).</p>
<p>In this data protection information we inform you about which of your personal data we process, the purposes for processing as well as the legal basis for it and which rights you have as a data subject if you use this app.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the purpose of this app?</h1>
<p>The main function of this app is to enable you to record contacts with other people, so&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>you can inform your contacts if you are ill or suspect to be ill</li>
<li>you will be informed if one of your contacts has reported sick</li>
<li>you will receive an all-clear notice if one of your contacts revokes his or her sick report</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app is designed to enable people at risk of infection to take special protective measures and to prevent the virus from spreading, as far as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also find links in the app that lead to information about the COVID-19 virus and contact points that you can contact for help. There is also a questionnaire where you can enter any symptoms you may have and get an answer as to whether these symptoms indicate that you are infected with the COVID-19 disease. Within this app no decisions solely based on automated processing are made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We expressly point out that the functions and information provided cannot replace the advice of a doctor. In case of any questions about the disease and therapy, we recommend to contact a doctor. We do not make any therapy recommendations when using the app.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to give you even more details about how the app, we have set up a page for you where we offer answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ):&nbsp; https://www.roteskreuz.at/site/faq-app-stopp-corona/</p>
<h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is personal data?</h1>
<p>Personal data includes any information which relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. During the development of this app, we placed great emphasis on processing as little personal data as possible from you. Because: the less data we process from you, the higher the protection of your privacy and the lower the risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>When first using the app, it is not necessary to enter any personal data. With the installation, your device (=smartphone) is only assigned a unique, randomly generated key (&ldquo;ID&rdquo;), which is transmitted to the server we use. Additionally, further randomly generated IDs are created for technical processing in order to provide the services. These IDs are a so-called pseudonymous data. This means that we cannot make any reference to you without gathering any further information. In addition to "normal" personal data, there is also the colloquially called "sensitive" data. According to the GDPR, these are called "special categories of personal data" (see Art. 9 GDPR). Health data is a type of such sensitive data. These must be handled with even more caution.</p>
<p>We then inform you about the functions of the app in which we process which data and what the legal basis is for us to do so.</p>
<h1><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Which personal data of yours are processed?</h1>
<p>Depending on your specific use of the functions of the app, we process the following data:</p>
<h2>4.1. Data collected when the app is downloaded</h2>
<p>If you download the app from the App Store (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store), you will have to enter data there (e.g. user name, email address). This will then be transmitted to the app store and processed along with other information such as the customer number of your account, the time of the download and the individual device code. This data is processed exclusively by the respective app store and is beyond our control and we are not the controller for this processing. Data protection information can be found directly at Google and Apple: https://policies.google.com/privacy or https://support.apple.com/de-at/HT210584 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.2. Data that is processed when the app is installed</h2>
<p>As already mentioned above, you do not have to enter any personal data to use the app. However, you - or your smartphone - receive a unique, randomly generated key figure (&ldquo;ID&rdquo;) by the app, which is transmitted to the server we use.</p>
<p>The app will also create an asymmetric key pair on your device for the purpose of being able to receive messages addressed to you. The public key is exchanged during the digital handshake. The private key is used to decrypt messages for the intended user (sick-alert or take back of sick warning). Only by being in possession of the private key is it possible for the user to decrypt and read messages (sick-alerts or all-clear messages) addressed to him or her by another person with whom a handshake was exchanged.</p>
<p>The processing of your personal data takes place on the basis of your express consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a and Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR). You can only use the app if you give this consent, which you will be asked to start with. If you change your mind, you can withdraw your consent at any time. As long as you haven't sent a sick report, you can easily do so by uninstalling or deleting the Stop Corona app. This means that we no longer have any personal data from you. Additionally, you can partially revoke consent by deactivating the automated &ldquo;digital handshake&rdquo; within the app. This does not affect the lawfulness of processing until revocation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.3. Data required for the technical provision of the app</h2>
<p>Every communication via the Internet requires certain data to enable the flow of information. In this specific case, the following data is required for the installation and use of the app for the communication between your end device (mobile phone) and our server:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- IP address</p>
<p>- Date and time of the request</p>
<p>- Configuration (language settings, device type and version of the operating system)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The processing of this personal data of yours is based on the legitimate interest (Article 6 Para 1 lit.f of GDPR): the temporary processing of the data provided by the system is necessary to allow communication between end device and server. A storage or integration of this data with other personal data of yours does not take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose of their collection. This is the case with the data collected for the purpose of provision of the app when the respective session has ended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.4. Data that are processed in the digital handshake</h2>
<p>The <strong>automatic digital handshake is</strong> activated by default between Android devices. Technically this is handled with the help of p2pkit from Uepaa AG (Switzerland). p2pkit creates randomly generated keys ("p2pID") before the handshake is carried out. These are transmitted along with time information, the device model and operating system information to the servers of Uepaa AG.Additionally, the public key is sent to their server for the handshake partner to collect it. &nbsp;A functional description of p2pkit can be found under point 5.3.3 of this document.</p>
<p>If you or your handshake partner who is Android user have deactivated the automatic digital handshake, or if an iOS device is involved in the digital handshake, the <strong>manual digital handshake</strong> is used. With deactivation, all processing of the automated handshake will cease. However, the tokens already shared with your previous handshake partners will stay in your local storage.</p>
<p>The manual handshake is technically processed using Google Nearby. This process does not require an internet connection for communication between Android devices and does not transfer any data to third parties.</p>
<p>If an iOS device is involved in the manual digital handshake, Google Nearby creates a randomly generated key figure (&ldquo;token&rdquo;) that is exchanged between the handshake partners. This token is then used by the handshake partner to collect the public key of the handshake partner via the Google Cloud Platform. A functional description of Google Nearby is provided under point 5.3.4 of this document.</p>
<p>The legal basis in both cases is your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 a GDPR and Art. 9 Para. 2 a GDPR). You can only use this function if you give your consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.5. Data that are processed in the event of reporting sick</h2>
<p>There are two ways to report sick:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a medical certificate and your illness is thus definitely established</li>
<li>if you use the symptom checker (= questionnaire) and based on the results think that you are probably sick</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately after your report, all persons with whom you have made a digital handshake via the app within the last 54 hours beforehand will be informed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both cases, you must provide your phone number before submitting the report.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to make sure that there is no abuse. To ensure that no arbitrary number is entered, a TAN will be sent to your cell phone, which you must enter in the registration form to continue.</li>
<li>We can also contact you on the phone number for any assistance you may need.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TAN and the telephone number go through the SMS gateway from us and then to the server. Your medical certificate or the results of the symptom checker will not be sent.</p>
<p>We use the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to send the messages. You can find information on this in point 5.3.2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately after your notification of illness, your contacts of the past 54 days will be informed that one of your &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; contacts is considered infected including the hour, when the contact took place. This gives your contacts the opportunity to warn other people with whom they have been in contact with after this time. Your telephone number will never be disclosed to your contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transmission of your sickness report and your telephone number is voluntary. This data processing is justified by your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR and Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR). However, you can only use the sick notification function - and thus the notification of your contacts - if you give your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time, whereby the revocation does not affect the legality of the processing until revoked. Please be aware, that we will not delete your telephone number or sick notice immediately after revoking your consent, but will store it based on a different legal basis:We will then keep the telephone number for 30 days as a measure to be able to follow up, in case the specific suspicion of improper and / or unlawful use arises. This is a necessary processing to assert, exercise or defend legal claims, which is justified by Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f and Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. f GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.6. Data that will be processed in the event of an all-clear notification</h2>
<p>If you sent a warning message to your contacts of the past 54 hours, after using the Symptom Checker, and it turns out that it fortunately was a "false alarm", because for example a COVID 19 test showed that you are not infected, then you can use the "all-clear" function. This will lead to your previously alarmed handshake partners being informed about this status update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The legal basis for this processing is again your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a and Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR) that you gave us when you sent the sick report. You are entitled to revoke your consent at any time, whereby the revocation does not affect the legality of the processing until revoked.</p>
<p>If you do not give your consent, this function cannot be used and your contacts will not receive notification of the all-clear.</p>
<p>We use the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to send the messages. You can find information on this in point 5.3.2.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>4.7. Data that we process for statistical purposes</h2>
<p>As of the Stopp Corona app version 1.1.3. (21<sup>st</sup> of April 2020) we will not process data for statistical purposes. In further versions though, we will count the number of messages and handshakes and the number of installations of the app. With whom the contacts took place is not recorded.</p>
<p>This quantitative data is processed without the possibility of traceability to your person, thus in an anonymised and aggregated form, for statistical purposes. The legal basis for this is Section 7 (1) 2 DSG in conjunction with Art. 6 (1) lit. a and Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we share your data?</h1>
<p>Your personal data will not be transmitted without your prior consent in addition to the cases explicitly mentioned in this data protection information. The data you provide by using the app will be passed on within the Austrian Red Cross for internal administrative purposes insofar as necessary. Your personal data may be transmitted in the following cases:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.1. Abuse and law enforcement</h2>
<p>If it is necessary to investigate any illegal or improper use of the app or for legal prosecution, personal data will be forwarded to law enforcement or other authorities and, if necessary, to damaged third parties or legal advisers. However, this shall only happen if there are any indications of illegal or abusive behaviour; in the defence against such behaviour is also our legitimate interest. Therefore, we rely on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR in conjunction with Art. 9 (2) (f) GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.2. Epidemic Act</h2>
<p>For the transmission of any information about specific cases of infection to the health authorities, Art. 9 (2) (i) GDPR in conjunction with &sect; 10 (2, DPA a corresponding legal basis. The current epidemic shall be considered as a catastrophe in accordance with &sect; 10 (1) GDPR. In addition, at the request of the district administrative authorities, the person responsible may be required to provide information on suspected cases and infections in accordance with &sect; 5 (3) of the 1950 Epidemic Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word;">We point out that, in accordance with Section 5(3) of the Epidemic Act, all persons, such as in particular doctors, laboratories, employers, family members and personnel of community institutions who could contribute to registrations, are obliged to provide information at the <strong>request</strong> of a district administration authority&nbsp; (https://www.help.gv.at/Portal.Node/hlpd/public/content/behoerden.html). &nbsp;Even if such a transfer of data (telephone number) by the Red Cross to the responsible district administration authority is not intended and is not technically implemented, we may be forced to hand over their telephone number. Should such a case arise, the legal basis is Art 6 sec. 1 lit c iVm Art. 9 sec. 2 lit i GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions about who shall be informed in case of any infections or suspected cases, please contact the health authorities. The &ldquo;Symptom Checker&rdquo; (questionnaire) reports a suspicion of the disease only to the Red Cross and not to authorities or other bodies.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>5.3. Processors and external services</h2>
<p>We rely on external service providers for the provision of our service, who are referred to as processors according to the GDPR. Any disclosure of the personal data shall be justified by the fact that we have carefully selected our external service providers as processors within the framework of Art. 28 (1) GDPR, regularly checked them and contractually obliged to process all personal data exclusively in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, these are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5.3.1 Operation and maintenance of the &ldquo;Stop Corona&rdquo; app (including backend)</h3>
<p>We have outsourced the development, operation and maintenance of the software to a reliable partner: Accenture GmbH, Stock Exchange building, Schottenring 16, 1010 Vienna.</p>
<p>Accenture uses other individually approved service providers to provide the hosting and technical operation of the app and server (&ldquo;backend&rdquo;) as well as the maintenance in the event of a malfunction and technical data security.</p>
<p>As a hosting service provider, Accenture uses Microsoft's cloud service called Azure.</p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word;">Microsoft will potentially use further processors s. https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2JOJ1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5.3.2 Push notifications via "Firebase Cloud Messaging"</h3>
<p>In order to enable the sending of push notifications, a &ldquo;Firebase Cloud Messaging Registration Token&rdquo; is created when the app is started for the first time, which uniquely identifies the app installation on your device. The token is used to recognise the message destination. The messages are sent via the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging service, which is provided by Google, Inc. Mountain View, USA, so that a part of the corresponding data processing carried out by Google on our behalf takes place in the USA. Further information on Google Firebase Cloud Messaging can be found at https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/ .</p>
<p>For Apple smartphones (iOS): Firebase Cloud Messaging will forward push notifications for iOS devices to &ldquo;Apple Push Notification Service&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5.3.3 p2pkit</h3>
<p>The automatic digital handshake is technically implemented by the p2pkit. This enables spatial distances between potential handshake partners to be determined (discovery function) and sent to these messages (messaging function).</p>
<p>The discovery function uses Bluetooth and WiFi Direct. The Bluetooth function does not pair with other devices, but compares the received signal strengths of the devices with each other. If these are similar, it can be concluded that they are close together.</p>
<p>As part of the messaging function, devices exchange pseudonymous tokens using the infrastructure of Uepaa AG, which uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a subcontractor. Neither Uepaa AG nor Accenture GmbH save your IP address. In the course of the discovery function and the messaging function, the following will be processed by Uepaa AG:</p>
<ul>
<li>time stamp</li>
<li>App ID (unique identifier of the p2pkit service)</li>
<li>User ID (unique pseudonym of the user, which is used only in the context of the automatic handshake)</li>
<li>Operating system and operating system version of the device</li>
<li>Device model</li>
<li>p2pkit version</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uepaa AG is developer and provider of p2pkit</p>
<p>Uepaa AG, Sonnhaldenstrasse 17, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a hosting service provider, Uepaa AG uses Amazon's cloud service, called Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5.3.4 Google Nearby &ndash; external service</h3>
<p>Google Nearby uses the WiFi, Bluetooth and ultrasound functions of your device to determine spatial distances between potential handshake partners and to exchange data. In this case, your device emits ultrasound sounds that are inaudible to humans and are registered by the microphones of other users in your area. This process does not require an internet connection for communication between Android devices and does not transfer any data to third parties because the necessary communication ultimately takes place directly via Bluetooth (Nearby Connections API). If an iOS device is involved in the digital handshake, a randomly generated key figure (&ldquo;token&rdquo;) is generated in the course of the handshake, which is compared by the handshake partners using the Google Cloud Platform (Nearby Messages API). Google Nearby is a service that is used by users at the end device. The controller for data protection is Google, Inc. Mountain View, USA. Part of the corresponding data processing carried out by Google on our behalf takes place in the USA. &nbsp;Further information on Google Firebase Cloud Messaging can be found at https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/ and in Google's privacy policy at http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.4. Transmission to third countries</h2>
<p>We also process data in countries outside the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;). This applies to the (sub) order processors Uepa, Google, Microsoft and Amazon mentioned above. For the United States, the European Commission made a decision on 26/07/2000 that an appropriate level of data protection exists under the regulations of the EU-US Privacy Shield (adequacy decision, Art. 45 (3) GDPR).</p>
<p>For the United States, the European Commission made a decision on 12 July 2016 that an appropriate level of data protection exists under the regulations of the EU-US Privacy Shield (adequacy decision, Art. 45 (3) GDPR). Google, Microsoft and Amazon are companies certified according to the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>In this context, we would like to point out that, due to the encryption of the data, it is not possible to identify data subjects for the processors. Such information cannot be derived from the processing context. In particular, the notification of illness of a user (an ID) is always sent to all end devices with an installed app, whereby the ID of the infected person is encrypted and may only be decrypted by those participants who have carried out a digital handshake. The digital handshake results in the exchanges of the private key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5.5 Transmission to other app users</h2>
<p>In connection with the use of the Stopp Corona App, data is transmitted to the individual App users, which is necessary for the App to function. Pseudonymised tokens (user IDs) of other app users are collected via the terminal devices when a digital handshake is performed or suspicious cases, illnesses or all-clear are reported.&nbsp; The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a and Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR (consent). However, we would like to point out that after revoking your consent (by deleting the Stopp Corona App), we have no possibility to delete tokens directly from other devices, as we cannot assign these tokens to a person or a specific device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do we delete your data?</h1>
<p>We delete or anonymise your personal data as soon as it is no longer required for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the above paragraphs. You can delete the data (tokens) stored locally on your end device by uninstalling or deleting the Stopp Corona App. Metadata stored by Uepaa AG (see point 5.3.3) is automatically deleted after 14 days. Data on the terminal device for the digital handshake with intensive contacts are deleted in the device after 7 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as a notification of illness has been submitted, your data will be stored for 30 days after the notification. If it is necessary to clarify an illegal or abusive use of the app or for legal prosecution and if there are any specific indications of illegal or abusive behaviour, your data will be stored for a period of up to three years after the notification of illness has been submitted.</p>
<p>Otherwise we will delete all data after the epidemic ends. Since an end is currently not foreseeable, no specific time of deletion can be provided. The Red Cross is part of the Austrian crisis unit and will therefore make an appropriate and transparent decision in close consultation with the authorities and announce when the purpose of the application has been fulfilled. We all hope that this will happen as soon as possible and that we can contribute, not least through the Stopp Corona app.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What rights do you have?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7.1 General remark on data subject rights</h2>
<p>We are not able to identify you with the data processed within the Stopp Corona App, except for your telephone number. Therefore, we cannot easily meet the requirements of articles 15 to 20 with regard to this data. In order to meet the requirements of articles 15 to 20, we will therefore generally need your cooperation.</p>
<p>With regard to data that enables us to identify you specifically (in any case your telephone number), we can fulfil the following rights of data subjects:</p>
<h2>7.1 Right of access</h2>
<p>You have the right to obtain from us upon request confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are processed within the scope of Article 15 GDPR.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>7.2 Right to rectify incorrect data</h2>
<p>You have the right to request from us to immediately rectify your personal data if they are incorrect.</p>
<h2>7.3 Right to deletion</h2>
<p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data under the conditions described in Art. 17 GDPR. These requirements provide, in particular, a right to deletion if the personal data are no longer necessary for those purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed as well as in cases of unlawful processing; even if you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal basis for processing, you have the right of erasure</p>
<h2>7.4 Right to restriction of processing</h2>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict the processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR. This right exists in particular if the accuracy of the personal data between the user and us is controversial, for the duration required by the verification of the correctness and in case that the user requests a restricted processing instead of the deletion if there is an existing right to deletion; furthermore, in the event that the data are no longer required for the purposes pursued by us, but the user needs them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
<h2>7.5 Right to data portability</h2>
<p>You have the right to receive from us the personal data relating to you that you have provided to us in a structured, common, machine-readable format pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR.</p>
<h2>7.6 Right to object</h2>
<p>For all the data processing that we carry out based on Art. 6 para. 1 letter f GDPR (see 5.3.1- 5.3.4), you have the right to object in accordance with Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR. This means that you can object to data processing for reasons arising from your particular situation at any time. However, an objection only leads to the omission of processing if the objection is justified by special reasons. We will no longer process the personal data unless we can prove compelling reasons for processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. In this case, please send your objection to datenschutz@roteskreuz.at , contact us by phone at +43 1 58900-955 or by post to Austrian Red Cross, General Secretariat - Data Protection, Wiedner Hauptstrasse 32, 1040 Vienna.</p>
